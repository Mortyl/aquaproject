			<figcaption>Squid</figcaption>
			<p>Squid in the twilight zone have some interesting adaptions which help them to survive and thrive in this zone. Perhaps the most perculiar is the pair of irregular sized eyes. The larger eye is for gazing upwards, looking for shadows of sea creatures against fading sunlight, while the smaller eye is adapted for looking downwards into darker water for flashes of bioluminescence.</p>

			<figcaption>Sperm Whale</figcaption>
			<p>Although sperm whales can dive to depths of up to 3km, they also spend a significant amount of time in the twilight zone. They spend approximately 20-40 minutes here at a time hunting their favourite food which is the giant squid. It eats dozens of squid during each feeding session, or up to a tonne in total.</p>

			<figcaption>Silver Hatchetfish</figcaption>
			<p>The hatchetfish has large eyes to aid vision in the twilight zone. It also is well camouflaged, with light producing organs giving off a blue hue that mimics daylight filtering down from above. The silver reflective body confuses prey by acting as a mirror against the surroundings.</p>

			<figcaption>Opisthotheusis californiana ("dumbo octopus")</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>The flapjack octopus usually appears as transparent to dark red.Their maximum size is 20 cm mantle length. They have eight jointed legs which are affixed together in an umbrella shape. They have a gelatinous body, which spreads into a parachute shape when maneuvering through dimly lit water. The flapjack preys on small fishes and planktonic crustaceans. They swim by moving their fins, pulsing their webbed arms, pushing water through their funnel for jet propulsion, or all three at once. Their depth range is: Para-larvae 200m, adults 500-1500m.</p>

			<figcaption>Anglerfish</figcaption>

		<p>Anglerfishes are fish of the teleost order Lophiiformes. They are bony fish named for their characteristic mode of predation, in which a fleshy growth from the fish's head (the esca or illicium) acts as a lure. Anglerfish occur worldwide. Some are pelagic (dwelling away from the sea floor), while others are benthic (dwelling close to the sea floor); some live in the deep sea (e.g., Ceratiidae), while others on the continental shelf (e.g. the frogfishes Antennariidae and the monkfish/goosefish Lophiidae). Pelagic forms are most laterally compressed, whereas the benthic forms are often extremely dorsoventrally compressed (depressed), often with large upward-pointing mouths.</p>

		<p>Stauroteuthis syrtensis, also known as the glowing sucker octopus, is a species of small pelagic octopus found at great depths in the north Atlantic Ocean. It is one of a very small number of octopuses to exhibit bioluminescence. Stauroteuthis syrtensis is found in the North Atlantic at an extreme depth range of 500 to 4,000 m (1,600 to 13,100 ft). It is most frequently found a few hundred metres from the bottom of the ocean at depths between 1,500 and 2,500 m (4,900 and 8,200 ft). It seems to be fairly common off the edge of the continental shelf on the eastern coast of the United States, and has also been observed at similar depths off the British Isles</p>
